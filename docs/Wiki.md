# Hepz-Grind

## Features

If a user with the `hep` role exists in a server, everytime that user enters a 
game (specifically VALORANT [1]) the play time is tracked and will send the 
message below:

```text
Hep started playing <gamename>.
```

Once that user is done playing the bot will send the following message:

```text
Hep played <gamename> for <xxx> Hours, <xxx> Mins, <xxx> Seconds

Total Hep playtime is: <xxx> Hours, <xxx> Mins, <xxx> Seconds
```

[1] Maybe we extend this to more later on.
